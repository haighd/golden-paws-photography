### This is Remie

...the heart behind Golden Paws Photography.

He was more than just my dog. He was my shadow, my protector, my joy. Always by my feet, always ready to welcome a new friend (furry or human), and always up for a golden hour adventure.

Golden Paws was born from the love I have for him — and the desire to capture that kind of bond for others. Every wag, every snuggle, every soulful gaze… that’s what I aim to preserve with every photo I take.

You’ll see glimpses of Remie throughout this page, because he’ll always be part of the story.
